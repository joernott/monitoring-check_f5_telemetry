# monitoring-check_f5_telemetry

This is a simple Icinga/Nagios check reading Statistics generated by the f5_telemetry module
(see <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/>)

## Usage

As this check uses viper and cobra for commandline, environment and configuration parsing, all commandline flags can also be provided by configuration file, which must then be specified with the *config* parameter or via environment variable. The variables use the prefix "CF5_" and are upper case letters. So, instead of providing the password at the command line (which is then visible in the process list), you can provide it by setting the environment variable "CF5_PASSWORD" or putting it into the config file. Choose your poison.

### Without command

Calling check_f5_telemetry without any command verb will output the help page. You need to provide one of the available commands to get soemthing useful done.
